Random Plymouth Themes

The script I'm using is based off [plymouth-themes](- based on https://github.com/adi1090x/plymouth-themes) by @adi1090x.  I've modified the script a bit while experimenting with plymouth.

The themes are based off Creative Commons videos with infinite looping.  I'm lazy, so the loops are not really loops - to keep the space minimal - I cut them off after some number of frames and let them temporarily glitch, but I think they still look really cool.

I haven't tested them anywhere else except on my own laptop.
